Someone who just spent hours *working on something for fun* for this Potentially Pointless Project may not want to put much time into writing documentation, which has only ~55% chance of improving your teammate's ability to access, understand, and react to your hard work.

By creating a document that shows any attempt and helping people know what to do, you are **protected from a penalty -1 documentation points.**

> **protected from a penalty -1 documentation points** *does not mean* you are protected from lovingly administered teasing and the creation of an educational moment, thanks to Wingbird Tippi Fifestarr.

``` isPenaltyProtected(true) != isNotAnIssueNeedingWorkBySomeone(true) // != *(does not mean)*```

If you are embarrassed, feel free to reject this merge.

## why cromewar made 1w33k-smartContracts

Peter wanted an alternative to Poap, so this project is an example about how to use the NTT and mint the badges.

I don't think I have any pretentions, this project is just s showcase about how to implement the same solution using another standard.

I'll expect you to see this just as a reference of an alternative, that's all.

# Instruction

1. since you are not added as collaborators, fork this repo
1. git clone the repo onto your local machine
1. use Brownie to deploy
1. then what?

## Next Steps

Can we share this to wellnessDAO? They are currently working on a way to reward certain attendees of their Discord Sound Bath event, I recommended a POAP but they want to teach people about NFTs, so I guess this doesn't do that, unless we make a public and free educational experience/Spanish language demo YouTube video of it (and I get paid to translate to English) and explain how they or we could use it, and what the difference between NFT, NTT, and POAP is. 
> WellnessDAO does not want to incur ANY COST to their members in order to recieve their gift, and as such it is +1 gift points for them, if they manage a POAP or NTT or NFT airdrop.
